            <li>We can see four distinct sections in this graph.</li>
            <li>Section A: Between 0.0 and 2.5 meters (<code>1.04 s</code>)</li>
            <li>Section B: Between 2.5 and 5.0 meters (<code>0.67 s</code>)</li>
            <li>Section C: Between 5.0 and 7.5 meters (<code>0.62 s</code>)</li>

        <ul>
            <li>We have a total average velocity of <code>3.26 m/s</code> over the course of the <code>10 m</code> distance.</li>
            <li>In Section A, the average velocity was <code>2.40 m/s</code>.</li>
            <li>In Section B, the average velocity was <code>3.75 m/s</code>.</li>
            <li>In Section C, the average velocity was <code>4.03 m/s</code>.</li>
            <li>In Section D, the average velocity was <code>3.39 m/s</code>.</li>

        <h1 class="text-xl font-bold">Forces</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>In each of the sections of the graph, we can see the forces that are in play.</li>
            <li>In Section A, Subject M maintains their speed, which shows us that there is no acceleration, which means that the forces are balanced and there is a constant velocity.</li>
            <li>In Section B, Subject M speeds up, which shows us that there is some positive acceleration towards the end, which shows that the forces are imbalanced and there is less drag force than there is push force.</li>
            <li>In Section C, Subject M maintains their speed, which shows us that there is no acceleration, which means that the forces are balanced and there is a constant velocity.</li>
            <li>In Section D, Subject M slows down, which shows us that there is some negative acceleration towards the end, which shows that the forces are imbalanced and there is more drag force than there is push force.</li>
